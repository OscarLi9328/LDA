1. Run start_LDF will get the least square approach for the linear classification. 
    It will also get the visualization of the boundaries and the plot for extra problem for comparison between least squares and Fisher discriminant.

2. Run start_Fisher to get the result of Fisher projection and KNN classification for linear classfication.
   It will also get the visualization of the boundaries and the plot for extra problem for comparison between least squares and Fisher discriminant.
